This line of research focuses on the novel from a global perspective. Aiming at a global history of the genre through the study of crucial transnational literary periods and spaces, the goal is to investigate the emergence and transformations of the modern and contemporary novel in its articulations across Europe and the world.

The scope of research encompasses both comparative literary history and theory, and it ranges from cross-national analysis of the history of the novel considered in its longue *dur√©e*, with special attention to the problem of historical change, to examinations of the novel and the representations of space, assessing the new tropes, forms and plots of the global novel. This research line also contributes to contemporary debates about the place of the novel within the canons and theoretical models of world literature, while maintaining a critical perspective on the role attributed to the novel in the historical processes and narratives of globalization.
