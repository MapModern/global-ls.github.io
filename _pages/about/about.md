          - title: "Global Literary Environments"
            excerpt: "This research focus examines the uses and representations of global environments in literature and film, and uses those under-examined spaces as the keys to examining the contradictions and ambivalences produced by spaces that are defined as international, and therefore paradigmatically “global”."

            excerpt: "This line of research focuses on the novel from a global perspective. Aiming at a global history of the genre through the study of crucial transnational literary periods and spaces, the goal is to investigate the emergence and transformations of the modern and contemporary novel in its articulations across Europe and the world."

            excerpt: "This line of research builds on cross-border studies and their criticism of a nation-centred research lens and focuses on dealing with circulation, mediations and mediators related to global literary translation flows and their transnational agents and agencies (translators, publishers, literary agents, institutions and book fairs)."

The Global Literary Studies Research Group (GlobaLS) focuses on the study of literary history from a global perspective, which we understand as a research approach that looks at cross-border cultural and literary phenomena beyond the national framework. Accordingly, this group has four main scientific objectives:

1. To review existing theoretical frameworks dealing with the notion of the “global” in order to further its application within literary studies, taking on new analytical units such as cities, regions, rivers, seas, and oceans.
2. To promote the global study of literature from an interdisciplinary perspective within the humanities and the social sciences.
3. To contribute to the analysis of literary processes, places and actors at a local and global scale through different case studies.
4. To contribute to the advancement of the global study of literature using macro- and micro-historical analyses and computational tools within a digital humanities framework.

These scientific objectives will be tested by means of a triple research focus: global literary environments, the global novel and global translation flows.
