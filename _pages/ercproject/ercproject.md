This research applies cutting-edge technology to analyse a neglected aspect of European and non-European social and cultural life of the 20th century: the impact of Hispanic and Lusophone literary networks and cultural mediators in international modernity between 1898 and 1959.   
The project pursues three central goals:
   1. to retrieve the lost history of Iberoamerican mediators in modernist intercultural and multilingual networks and reappraise their role;
   2. to narrow the knowledge divide in terms of access and production in the Iberoamerican field by generating and making freely available new and reliable data that addresses the lack of documented cultural heritage, and
   3. to offer an innovative and reproducible model that can be applied across periods, languages, and disciplines to analyse cross-border phenomena, under-examined mediators and networks and overshadowed geographical scales in their relations to the wider world.

These goals will be achieved by a twofold methodology:
   * i) an open and collaborative research tool providing a data source for quantitative and qualitative analysis on Iberoamerican mediators, and
   * ii) four subprojects on key cultural transformation processes distinctive of modern societies  (the institutionalization of Iberoamerican cultures, the rise of translated literature in key Iberoamerican modernist journals, the position of Iberoamerican women in the cultural field, and the role of Iberoamerican mediators in new forms of mass media).

   By combining computational methods, cultural and literary history, translation, sociology, gender and media studies, an interdisciplinary team of 6 researchers  will fill the gap in modernist studies and will significantly contribute, with an empirically tested method, to open new methodological paths for a decentred global cultural history.


Duration: December 2018 - December 2023
