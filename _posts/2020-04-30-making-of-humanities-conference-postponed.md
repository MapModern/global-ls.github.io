Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Society for the History of the Humanities has decided out of an abundance of caution that the 9th Making of the Humanities conference, originally scheduled for the fall of 2020, will now be taking place in 2021. The Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) together with the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) will host the 9th Making of the Humanities conference, from **20 to 22 September 2021**, at the facilities of the UPF Faculty of Humanities, Ciutadella Campus, Jaume I building.

The revised call for papers and panels is available on the [SHOH website](http://www.historyofhumanities.org/2019/12/13/call-for-papers-and-panels-the-making-of-the-humanities-ix/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=http%3A//www.historyofhumanities.org/2019/12/13/call-for-papers-and-panels-the-making-of-the-humanities-ix/&utm_campaign=Emma%20-%20MOH-IX%20postponement) and will be circulated again in early 2021.
