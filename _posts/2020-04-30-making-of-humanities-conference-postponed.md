Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Society for the History of the Humanities has decided to postpone the 9th Making of the Humanities conference, originally scheduled for the fall of 2020, to **20-22 September 2021**. Panels and papers on any period or region are welcome. Special interest is given to work that transcends the history of specific humanities disciplines by comparing scholarly practices across disciplines and civilisations. **Neus Rotger** is part of the local organizing committee. **NEW Final Deadline** for the submission of abstracts and panel proposals: **1 May 2021**.

The revised call for papers and panels is available on the [SHOH website](http://www.historyofhumanities.org/2019/12/13/call-for-papers-and-panels-the-making-of-the-humanities-ix/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=http%3A//www.historyofhumanities.org/2019/12/13/call-for-papers-and-panels-the-making-of-the-humanities-ix/&utm_campaign=Emma%20-%20MOH-IX%20postponement) and will be circulated again in early 2021.
