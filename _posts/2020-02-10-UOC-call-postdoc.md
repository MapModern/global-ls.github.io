The UOC's Research and Innovation Committee has approved the publication of a call for five new three-year postdoctoral research stays at the UOC. The places are aimed at teaching staff and postdoctoral researchers specialized in any of the areas of knowledge covered by the University's research groups. **The deadline to apply is 1 March**.

The call is geared towards researchers holding a doctoral degree from the UOC or another institution who meet the [terms and conditions](http://www.uoc.edu/opencms_portal2/opencms/_resources/CA/documents/recerca/Bases_postdocs_2020/bases_postdocs_2020_EN_signades.pdf) set forth by the call. Candidates holding a doctoral degree from the UOC must provide proof of having carried out at least one other **postdoctoral stay** at **another university or research centre** for a minimum of **two years**.

**Honing in on interdisciplinary research**

Interested researchers will be able to choose between two research stay types while completing their application. On the one hand, they can request to carry out an **interdisciplinary postdoctoral stay**, an entirely new feature for calls of this nature. This option is the result of the UOC's push for interdisciplinary research, as laid out in its Strategic Plan. For the purposes of this call, interdisciplinary research is considered to be research which merges knowledge and methodology from different disciplines through an observable synthesis or combination of approaches. This differs from multidisciplinary research, in which researchers from different disciplines work together.

On the other hand, the call maintains the option available in past calls, offering a minimum of **four places** for researchers to join the UOC's research groups. To view a list of the University's research groups, click [here](http://transfer.rdi.uoc.edu/en/knowledge-map).

Researchers must indicate which option they would like to opt for. **They cannot apply for both**.

**Beneficiaries**

The researchers awarded the available places **must not have been employed by the UOC** at any time during the **two years prior** to the publication of this call. The **provisional decision** for the call will be published from **3 April**, and appeals can be made until 13 April. The appeals and final decision will then be made public from 17 April.
