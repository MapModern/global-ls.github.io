**Laura Fólica** will give a workshop on translating humour at the "36es Assises de la Traduction Littéraires", in Arles (8-10 November).  
The workshop will explore translation from French into Spanish based on the works of Alphonse Allais, compiled and translated by the workshop leader in the anthology *La ciencia no respeta nada* (La Fuga, 2018).
