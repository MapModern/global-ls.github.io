**Marta Puxan Oliva** was interviewed by [eldiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/) to discuss when to write about COVID-19 and not to fall into banality. She mentions that it is always a good time to write. Furthermore, that times of literature and illness are multiple, as is the case with the times of war. She concludes by saying that the historical moment we are experiencing can generate many types of literature at different times, such as science fiction literature, which would show a future affected by an hypothetical pandemic, testimonial literature, which would be a document of the present, and historical literature, which will evaluate the events that have occurred over time.
