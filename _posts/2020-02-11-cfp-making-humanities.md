‘The Making of the Humanities’ conference goes to Barcelona! The Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) together with the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) will host the 9th Making of the Humanities conference, from 21 to 23 September 2020, at the facilities of the UPF Faculty of Humanities.  
Panels and papers on any period or region are welcome. Special interest is given to work that transcend the history of specific humanities disciplines by comparing scholarly practices across disciplines and civilisations.  
The deadline for submitting abstracts and panel proposals is **7 May 2020**.

### Goal of the Making of the Humanities (MoH) Conferences

The MoH conferences are organized by the [Society for the History of the Humanities](http://www.historyofhumanities.org/) and bring together scholars and historians interested in the history of a wide variety of disciplines, including archaeology, art history, historiography, linguistics, literary studies, media studies, musicology, and philology, tracing these fields from their earliest developments to the modern day.

The organisers welcome panels and papers on any period or region. The organisers are especially interested in work that transcends the history of specific humanities disciplines by comparing scholarly practices across disciplines and civilisations.

This year there is a special conference theme. The organisers encourage submissions that explore this theme, but remain fully open to submissions addressing other subjects.

This year’s conference theme is **Unfolding Disciplines in the History of the Humanities**.  

A growing body of scholarship suggests that the historiography of the humanities is increasingly organized around new interdisciplinary collaborations that affect the very understanding of what it means to belong to a Humanities discipline. This year the organisers invite contributions that interlace different disciplinary approaches in order to frame humanistic scholarship in terms of a continued engagement with the limits and possibilities offered by the softening and even erasure of disciplinary boundaries. Participants are also encouraged to think expansively about the impact of the ongoing process of reinvention of established as well as new disciplinary fields as a result of increased cross-pollination and collaboration.

Please note that the Making of the Humanities conferences are not concerned with the history of art, the history of music or the history of literature, and so on, but instead with the history of art history, the history of musicology, the history of literary studies, etc.
